# Script1
### Exercise 1

In this folder you will find two files:

* index.html:

The functionality of this file is to create a web page where the JavaScript file can be viewed.

```html
<script src="/JSEscuela/js/Bloque2/script1.js" defer></script>
```
In that part of the html code, make sure to link the 'script1.js' file correctly according to where you have it in your files

* script1.js :

This file contains the script, which generates 10 containers with a height of 100px and adds a random background color to this container.

```javascript
const colors = ['red', 'purple', 'green', 'beige', 'aqua', 'brown', 'darkviolet']
```
You can modify the colors or add even more by changing the name of the color that is enclosed in the single quotes.

Here I leave you a page where the most common colors are found.

```javascript
div.style.height = '100px'
div.style.margin = '0.8rem 0px'
```
Here you can play with the height and margin of the containers.
